<h2 id="paying-the-bills">Paying the bills:</h2>
<p>While interning is great it doesn’t pay your bills (at least directly!)  So to help out I’ve also worked several jobs ranging from retail at Macy’s to crafting specialty beverages at Starbucks during college and after.  In all of these jobs I’ve been customer facing positions specializing in client relations.  Several have had special emphasis on customer service and relationship selling.  Others just teach you how to work on a team and keep you humble. They’ve been:
      - Macy’s Sales Associate
      - Starbucks Barista
      - Legends Hospitality Concessions
      - Centerplate Concessions
      - Aramark Student Employee
      - Hartman Center Summer Service Team</p>
